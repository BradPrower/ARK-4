Installation On PSP

    - Install `ARK_01234` folder into `/PSP/SAVEDATA/` folder.
    - Install `ARK_Live` folder into `/PSP/GAME/` folder.
    - Launch ARK Live Loader. It will install ARK modules on PSP Flash and boot the CFW.
    - To use `Infinity` place the `EBOOT.PBP` (or `EBOOT_GO.PBP` renamed to `EBOOT.PBP` if using a PSP Go) from the `Infinity` folder found in the ARK download into `/PSP/GAME/UPDATE`. \
        Install `Infinity` using Official Firmware, run ARK from Live Loader, and then run `Infinity` again to configure autoboot. \
        This will allow you to use ARK permanently and triple boot with PRO and ME.
    - You can also use the `cIPL` installer for a faster permanent CFW on 1K and early 2K models (models compatible with Pandora).
    - If you will be using the Live loader version of ARK instead of a permanent solution, it is recommended that you delete `FLASH0.ARK` from the savedata file after the first installation and bootup of ARK, otherwise the flash0 files will be installed every time you boot back to ARK and this is detrimental to the flash even if ARK installs very little and small files. Doing this will also make the Live loader boot up ARK faster.
    - To `update ARK` simply copy over the new `ARK_01234` savedata folder and run `ARK Loader` from `OFW`.



Installation On PS Vita

    - Works on 3.60 up to 3.74, either with or without Henkaku/h-encore.
    - Download a legit `PSP` game from `PSN`, the free demo of `Ape Quest` or `LocoRoco Midnight Carnival` is recommended. `Minis` are `NOT` recommended.
    - For Henkaku/h-encore users, install an ARK bubble using FastARK: https://github.com/theheroGAC/ArkFast/
    - Official Firmware users (no henkaku/h-encore) can install the PBOOT bubble manually: https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Trinity#preparation
    - Replace the ARK savedata folder (`ux0:pspemu/PSP/SAVEDATA/ARK_01234`) with the folder from latest release.
    - Copy `K.BIN` from VitaBubble folder into `ARK_01234` savedata folder.
    - To use right analog stick (i.e. gta_remastered plugin): https://github.com/rereprep/ArkRightAnalog
    - To `exit` from a game or homebrew back to the `custom launcher`, press `L+R+Down+Start`. Works on `PSP` too.
    - Some features are not available to Vita users, mainly the official Sony `XMB` and `PS1` games.
