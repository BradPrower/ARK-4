#### Compiling ARK ( For Developers )
<p>

    Build script will allow you to use the correct SDK that ARK was built with.

- Docker container: `docker pull docker.io/krazynez/ark-4:latest`

<p><b>These are utilized either with cloning the repo or using the Docker container</b></p>

- Release: `./build.sh` 
- Debug: `./build.sh --debug`
- Manually: install the oldest possible SDK (ideally the one used to compile M33), then run `make`

Use `-h` or `--help` to show all available flags 

</p>

<p>

###### Custom Themes
You can install themes within Custom Launcher (and Recovery Menu). Just place the `themes` folder anywhere on your PSP and use the file browser in the Custom Launcher to select which theme (`THEME.ARK`) you would like to install. By selecting it a submenu will pop up asking to install it or to preview the theme without installing.

###### Other Launchers
<p>

Aside from the default launcher provided, there have been many  other custom launchers created by scene members, some better looking, some with more features, some more simpler, but all of them with personality, dedication and love from the community.

Here is a list of all popular menus for ARK:

#### History
Despite being a relatively new `Custom Firmware` for the `PSP`, `ARK` has quite a history that goes back to the early days of the `PS Vita` scene.

`ARK` is a `CFW` that started as a port (more like rewrite) of `PRO CFW` to the `PS Vita` (named `PROVITA`) created by the original `Team PRO` members (`Coldbird`, `Liquid Snake` and `Neur0n`).
After the original team left, the source code of `PROVITA` was handed over to me (`Acid_Snake`) and my long time scene friend `qwikrazor87`.

We quickly began a huge process of rewriting and restructuring code, more specifically a much more robust dynamic patching algorithms that would work on any 6.6X based firmware (including all Vita's ePSP firmwares). Thus `ARK-2` was born.

Soon after, qwik, thefl0w and I began working on `PSX exploits`, which resulted in `TN-X` and `ARK-3` (never publicly released).

Because the original `PRO CFW` hasn't been updated or maintained in a while, and it has become a little bloated and hard to work with, I decided to start working on porting `ARK` to the `PSP` since the core elements of the `CFW` are compatible with `PSP` `6.60` and `6.61` with minor changes.

After lots of work getting the same `ARK` binaries to properly work on both PSP and Vita, I am proud to announce that the release of `ARK-4` is finally here!


#### Changelog

- `ARK-1`: original port/rewrite of `PRO CFW` for the `PS Vita`. Codenamed `PROVITA`. Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-1-PROVita-
- `ARK-2`: dynamic patching allows it to work with most of `PS Vita` firmwares. Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-2
- `ARK-3`: device-specific runtime allows `ARK` to run in multiple scenarios (`ePSP` and `ePSX`). Source code can be found here: https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-3
- `ARK-4`: ported to the original `PSP`. Huge amounts of improvements and fixes over previous versions.

#### Warnings
<p>

- ARK comes with no warranty whatsoever. It was designed to be noob-proof, however it is possible for the universe to create an even greater noob capable of using ARK to destroy the Earth (or his PSP). I cannot be held responsible for this.

- ARK may cause ejectile malfunction if your hard drive is not hard enough.

- If this software malfunctions, you can turn it off and on again.
